## odin-recipes

# Introduction  
A website that consists of the recipes I have personally tried, built with HTML skills I have acquired over the few weeks I have studied The Odin Project. (231123-021223)

# Recipes and Pictures taken from:

# Skills demonstrated  
Basic HTML skills acquired from The Odin Project

# Learning outcomes  
I should only be adding and committing the files that I have edited at each checkpoint instead of committing all the documents in the repository  
I should also choose pictures that have less awkward dimensions so that it looks nicer, otherwise I should specify the size of the picture in my code
